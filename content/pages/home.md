## Welcome!

I'm Will Hopper, a graduate student and TA at [UMass Amherst](https://www.umass.edu/pbs/) studying cognitive psychology. I'm advised by [Dr. David Huber](http://people.umass.edu/dehuber/) and work in the [CEMNL](http://people.umass.edu/dehuber/CEMNL.html) as a research assistant. I study episodic memory and perception, and try to understand these mental behaviors through conducting behavioral experiments and applying computational cognitive models.
