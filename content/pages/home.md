## Welcome!

I'm Will Hopper, a graduate student and TA at [UMass Amherst](http://www.psych.umass.edu/) studying cognitive psychology. I'm advised by [Dr. David Huber](http://people.umass.edu/dehuber/) and work in the [CEMNL](http://people.umass.edu/dehuber/CEMNL.html) as a research assistant.

I study episodic memory and perception, and try to understand these mental behaviors through conducting behavioral experiments and applying computational cognitive models. Check out the links below to see more of what I do!
