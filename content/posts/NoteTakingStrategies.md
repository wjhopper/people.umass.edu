**Always keep in mind your own research questions and goals, and use that focus on the most relevant information!**

1. Survey the entire reading before jumping into the full text
    - Skim through the paper to get a glimpse of the titles, figures and tables.
    - Then, read the abstract and the conclusions/discussions first.
2. Take notes **as you read the article**. In your notes, be sure to:
    - Identify what the big-picture research question/critical debate is
    - Write the key points and results from each major section in your own words
    - Record the methodology and experimental designs
    - Reference or copy any key tables/figures that illustrate the results
  - Connect the results to other important ideas
  - Note any questions your have or things that need clarification
  3. Use a template to help standardize your note taking, so you're not left with some good notes and some bad notes! It doesn't have to be overly complicated to be helpful. As proof, here's a copy-pasted version of my own template looks like.
