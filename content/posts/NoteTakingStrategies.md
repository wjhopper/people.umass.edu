Summary: The comprehensive exams for my graduate program division require students to write 3 research essays in 1 week! Good note taking during the reading period is key, and I'll try to share with you some reading and note taking strategies I used to succeed.

Last summer, I took my the comprehensive exams for my graduate program, better known as "comps". In my particular division of the psychology department (cognitive), our comprehensive exams take the form of writing 3 large essays on self-selected topics relevant to our personal research endeavors. Once our essay questions and associated reading lists (usually clocking in at 30-40 papers per essay question) are approved by a committee of faculty members, we are typically given 2-3 months to do the background research and reading necessary to write our essays. The catch is, **you then only have 1 week to write the 3 essays.**

This means you need to take good notes on all the papers and books on your reading list, because you probably won't have time to go back and review each article as you write. Since you're here, I'll give you my advice on how to take notes in a situation like this that will actually help you 6 weeks in the future, instead of just taking up time when you're reading.

## The Most Important Thing
The most important thing (and most difficult thing), is to know whats important to understand, and what to ignore;
it's a kind of expertise on its own. **Always use your specific comps questions and your own research goal to guide your focus to the most relevant information!** Any article or chapter is going to have information you don't need to focus on for a specific comps question. So, don't try to put the whole entire paper into your notes. Spend your time thoroughly understanding the most critical information, and documenting it in your own words in your notes.

## Things to do for each paper you read
Besides the high-level principle of focusing on the right things, there are a few other things you should do for each paper you read that will help you take notes that are simple, but also useful in the future!

1. Survey the entire reading before jumping into the full text
    - Skim through the paper to get a glimpse of the titles, figures and tables.
    - Then, read the abstract and the conclusions/discussions first to look for the "take-home" message
2. Take notes **as you read the article**.
3. In your notes for each article, be sure to:
    - Identify what the "big-picture" research question/debate is
    - Write the key points and results from each major section *in your own words*
    - Record the methodology and experimental design
    - Reference or copy any key tables/figures that illustrate the results
    - Note important connections to other papers in your reading list, and the larger themes of your essays
    - Any questions your have or things that need clarification

  I'd recommend using a template to help standardize your note taking, so you're not left with some good notes from when you were energetic and motivated, and some bad notes from when you were tired! It doesn't have to be overly complicated to be helpful. As proof, here's what my own template looks like.


<div style="padding-left: 50px; margin-bottom: 50px; border: 1px black solid; background: #f7f7f7;">
  <h4 id="authors-" style="margin-bottom: 0">Authors:</h6>
  <h4 id="year-" style="margin: 0 auto">Year:</h6>
  <h4 id="link-" style="margin: 0 auto" >Link:</h6>
  <h4 id="topic-and-questions-">Topic and Questions:</h4>
  <h4 id="context-">Context:</h4>
  <h4 id="experiment-1-" style="margin-bottom: 0">Experiment 1:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li><em>Methodology</em>:
      <ul>
        <li><em>Factors</em>:</li>
        <li><em>Measurement</em>:</li>
      </ul>
      </li>
    <li><em>Results</em>:</li>
    <li><em>Conclusions</em>:</li>
  </ul>
  <h4 id="summary-of-conclusions-">Summary of Conclusions:</h4>
  <h4 id="connections-to-other-literature-">Connections to other literature:</h4>
  <h4 id="questions-comments-">Questions/Comments:</h4>
</div>

I'd recommend taking your notes in a digital format, like in Microsoft Word or Evernote, as that makes it easier to include links to other digital resources, and to keep copies of figures/tables from an article together with your notes about it.
